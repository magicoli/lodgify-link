Synchronize WooCommerce booking orders with Lodifgy

## Description

Currently, the plugin provides a "booking id" field and a user-defined amount, to allow keeping track of payments related to bookings managed by another solution.

The final goal will be to use this booking id to fetch booking data from Lodgify and display a comprehensive detail of the reservation in WooCommerce order (accommodation, name of guest, booking dates, deposit and total amount...)
