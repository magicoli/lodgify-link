Synchronize WooCommerce booking orders with Lodifgy

## Description

Currently, the plugin simply provides booking id and user-defined amount fields to WooCommerce products, to allow keeping track of payments related to externally managed bookings.

The final goal will be to use this booking id to fetch booking data from Lodgify and display a comprehensive detail of the reservation in WooCommerce order (accommodation, name of guest, booking dates, deposit and total amount...)
